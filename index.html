<h2><strong><i>Agent Based Model:</i></Strong></h2>

<h3>About the Model:</h3>

This Agent Based Model (ABM) was constructed as part of the Programming For Georaphical Information Analysis: Core Skills module,
a component of the MSc Geographical Information Systems course, at The University of Leeds.<br><br>

Agent based models are useful, as they allow a user to a keep track of individual entities and analyse or adapt how they behave. An ABM allows this analysis to be at an individual level or as a group, as a model can give each entity its own agency, with its own individual behaviour and the ability to interact with other entities and the surrounding environment, effectively acting as an artificial intelligence.
ABMs generally run on an iteration basis, running for a defined period of time, allowing agents to behave until the number of iterations has been fulfilled or a stopping condition is reached.
ABMs therefore allow for complex patterns to be identified and analysed within an artificial system.<br>

In the case of this ABM, the model runs 10 agents within the environment for a period of 100 iterations, or until a random number less than zero is produced, in which case a stopping condition is produced.
The ABM has a basic graphical user interface (GUI), allowing a user to run the model through the loop of iterations, acting as a simulation of the behaviour of agents ineracting within an environment.



The code for the ABM is provided via GitHub, at:
